## System Requirements

You must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of python may not compile.

## Steps to Replicate 

1. Fork this repository and create a codespace in GitHub as I showed you in the youtube video OR Clone it locally.
```
git clone https://github.com/rtdjin300/falcon_chat.git
cd langchain-falcon-chainlit
```

2. Rename example.env to .env with `cp example.env .env`and input the huggingfacehub api token as follows. Get Huggingfacehub api token from this [URL](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). You need to create an account in Huggingface if you haven't already.
   ```
   HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   ```

3. Run the following command in the terminal to install necessary python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the following command in your terminal to start the chat UI:
   ```
   chainlit run langchain_falcon.py -w
   ```
